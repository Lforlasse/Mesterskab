Fundamental Network Topics

Understanding Basic Network Terms like IP, TCP/IP, DNS, DHCP and more.
These exercises are meant to be answered with text, based on internet searches so write down your reply so you will remember for later.

What is your public IP address right now, and how did you find it?
 - A service like "https://www.whatismyip.com/" will show you your current public ip-address. If you ip-address is not a static one, it will change from time to time.
    
What is your private IP address right now (do this both at home and in school), and who/what gave you that address?
 - "192.168.0.11", and is given to me by my network router. 
    
What’s special about these address ranges?
 - 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255: Is a 24-bit block ip-range and is classified as "Single Class A". Number of possible IP-adresses in this range is 16.777.216.
 - 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255: Is a 20-bit block ip-range and is classified as "Contiguous range of 16 Class B blocks". Number of possible IP-adresses in this range is 1.048.576.	
 - 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255: Is a 16-bit block ip-range and is classified as "Contiguous range of 256 Class C blocks". Number of possible IP-adresses in this range is 65.636.
 - They are all reserved for private/local networks.

What’s special about this ip-address: 127.0.0.1?
 - It's the localhost address and referes to the client itself.
    
What kind of service would you expect to find on a server using these ports: 22, 23, 25, 53, 80, 443?
 - 22:  SSH secure shell, secure logins, file transfers (SCP, SFTP) and port forwarding.
 - 23:  Telnet protocol, unencrypted text communications.
 - 25:  Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), used for email routing between mail servers.
 - 53:  Domain Name System (DNS). 
 - 80:  Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), can also be used as QUIC, a UDP protocol developed by google.
 - 443: Hypertext Transfer Protocol using TLS/SSL (HTTPS) for secure http connections, can also be used by QUIC, a UDP protocol developed by google.

What is the IP address of studypoints.info and how did you find it?
 - "157.230.21.145" - By using the command line utility "nslookup" with "studypoints.info" as parameter, it looks up the ip-address on the DNS.

If you write https://studypoints.info in your browser, how did “it” figure out that it should go to the IP address you discovered above?
 - By using a Domain Name Server (DNS), to lookup the ip-address for this specific domain.
    
Explain shortly the purpose of an ip-address and a port-number and why we need both
 - An ip-address referes to a specific device on a network, where the port-number referes to the specific route a specific protocol uses, and where the recieving device is "listening" for the specific data.

What is your (nearest) DNS server?
 - The nearest DNS server is provided by my Internet Service Provider (ISP).

What is (conceptually) the DNS system and the purpose with a DNS Server?
 - The Domain Name Server (DNS) is essentially a lookup-table for domain-names to know which ip-address to establish connections to. That way the user doesn't have to remember the ip-address of a service.

What is your current Gateway, and how did you find it?
 - "192.168.0.1", by using "ipconfig" in the commandline.

What is the address of your current DHCP-Server, and how did you find it?
 - "192.168.0.1", by using "ipconfig" in the commandline.

Explain (conceptually) about the TCP/IP-protocol stack
 - Is a tansport-layer protocol. The TCP/IP-protocol uses a 3-way handshake to first establish a connection and then syncronising the host and the client. This protocol ensure that all network packets sent by the host, is received by the client, as the client confirms that data was recieved.

Explain about the HTTP Protocol (the following exercises will go much deeper into this protocol)
 - Is an application-layer protocol. It is used for sending 'hypermedia documents' such as HTML and JSON.

Explain (conceptually) how HTTP and TCP/IP are connected (what can HTTP do, and where does it fit into TCP/IP)
 - HTTP is the application-layer where the TCP/IP is the transport-layer of the protocol stack that is HTTP and TCP/IP. HTTP is carrying the actual readable content for the user, while TCP/IP is establishing a synchronised connection in the background.
